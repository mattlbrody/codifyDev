						<p>"I took a different approach in life and decided to gain world experience rather than go to college.  After living in England for four years, I came back to the U.S. without a degree.  I took various jobs in marketing and real estate with no real advancement and it became apparent there never would be.  I am also a single mother so I knew I needed to make a change and fast.  I enrolled at Codify and it was a tremendous pay off.  I am now interning at Apple as a Software Engineer Intern and my future is looking brighter every day."</p>

						<p>"I decided to enroll in Codify Academy after a couple of years studying programming on my own. The part-time schedule, along with the mentorship of my instructor helped me get my skills to a level where I felt confident in my abilities. I now work as a full time web developer, earning a living doing what I love."</p>

						<p class="">Codify Academy has been an amazing experience for me. A little about myself when I started the course I was 21 years old working dead end jobs that required little skill. I felt I was doomed to stay at these jobs until I complete my bachelors in business administration which will still take me 5 years from now. I was feeling the need to learn a new skill that will give me a high pay & find somthing that will challenge me instead of repetitivness. My search ended when I ran into Codify.</p>
						<p>Now I'm so glad I took the course & I'm never looking back. My eyes have been open to a new world that I would have never imagined being even remotely involved with in this field but now I'm hooked. Trust me you GET what you GIVE & I'm living proof including my classmates who speak of jobs they are working their way into here in SF. My classmates & I come from all kinds of different backgrounds, goals, & places in life. What brought us all together & made us into better selves was this motivation to learn how to code & make somthing of ourselves. I highly suggest checking them out & just see what happens from there it might just suprise you.</p>

						<p class="">From the start of 2014, I was still on a confusing path.I was unsure if Codify Academy was the right choice or not, But I am glad I took the leap of faith because Codify Academy's material is powerful knowledge.

						If you are like me and can see great opportunities from a mile away, then you will see how Codify Academy can improve your job hunting or even just make some extra money on the side.

						I would like to give a thanks to the Brody brothers for presenting this opportunity which has kickstarted my career and skyrocketed my personal growth. My man Chris, was not just a mentor,but a true bro. I felt relaxed and comfortable and appreciate his genuine desire to want more from life as well as share that with those around him.

						After the program I aggressively applied for jobs. When I got interviewed and the very following day I heard this, "I have some good news for you - YOU GOT THE JOB!!!". It was such sweet satisfaction.

						Thank you again Chris and to the entire Codify Academy team.
